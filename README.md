**Requirements for all my PS Scripts** : Powershell 7+, i do not create script for older PS since PS7 is available on most OS.
Many functions will work on older Powershell versions, but since Microsoft will not do any update to Powershell 5 and lower (and there are multiple existing bugs) i do not plan and doing the support for them ;)

I just uploaded all my functions that i used for all kinds of stuff in iClic-Shared.psm1, do not hesitate to give me feedback if you find anything that is not working as expected.
I will add function descriptions as soon as i find a little time
